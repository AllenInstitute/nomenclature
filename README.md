# nomenclature
This repository contains code to generate standardized cell type nomenclature from an R "dendrogram".  Our nomenclature schema is described in detail [on our website, here](https://portal.brain-map.org/explore/classes/nomenclature).  

**[CLICK HERE](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/allen_institute_nomenclature/blob/master/build_annotation_tables.md)** to get started, or download the `build_annotation_tables.r` file.

Please visit [the Cell Taxonomy category of our community forum](https://community.brain-map.org/c/cell-taxonomies) to provide suggestions about the nomenclature schema itself.
