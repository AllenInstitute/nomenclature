# nomenclature
This repository contains code to generate the standardized **Common Cell type Nomenclature (CCN)** from an R "dendrogram", as described in our manuscript currently soon to be resubmitted to eLife.  The initial version of the CCN is described in detail [on our website, here](https://portal.brain-map.org/explore/classes/nomenclature), with and updated version now available [on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05406).  If you want to apply nomenclature of the format initiall described, please use the initial release.

**[CLICK HERE](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/allen_institute_nomenclature/blob/master/build_annotation_tables.md)** to get started, or download the `build_annotation_tables.r` file.

Please visit [the Cell Taxonomy category of our community forum](https://community.brain-map.org/c/cell-taxonomies) to provide suggestions about the nomenclature schema itself.

**Whether or not you use this repository for assigning nomenclature, please choose a taxonomy_id [NOT IN THIS TABLE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10gYNyOhc0YHOYKjgsvLfumf65CqLeiVDCE3Wrxz4Txo/edit?usp=sharing), and update the table with your taxonomy_ID.**  Strategies for better tracking of taxonomy IDs are currently under consideration.
